## ðŸ“Œ Overview:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a linear regression model capable of predicting tumor area (Area Mean) based on various diagnostic features.

Leveraging machine learning, Zenith Medical Analytics aims to explore how different cellular characteristics influence tumor size, which could contribute to better understanding of tumor growth patterns and potential risk factors.
